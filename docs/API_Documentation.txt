The API endpoints used by our user login system:

1. Get all the registered users (HTTP method GET) at endpoint /app/users/all
2. CREATE a new user (HTTP method POST) at endpoint /app/new/
3. READ a single user (HTTP method GET) at endpoint /app/user/:user/:pass

These are the CRUD API endpoints using express.js and better-sqlite3. The API works with the better-sqlite3 database to sign up new users or log in old users. 
User information will be validated by the database. Only correct pair of user name and password can successfully log in to the system and start to play the game. 
Otherwise, they are asked either to reenter the password or sign up for a new account.
