## Project Detail
We built a game system that is composed of a user login system and a snake game. 

### Login System 
Users must sign up for an account to play the game. User information will be stored and validated by the database (API Documents [here](https://github.com/huahanqi/a99-bestteamever/blob/main/docs/API_Documentation.txt)). Only correct pair of user name and password can successfully log in to the system and start to play the game. Inside the game, users can play the snake game multiple times, and the highest score will be recorded. If the user wants to exit, he/she can simply click the logout button and exit. Next time, the user still has to enter his/her account information to enter the system. 
### Snake Game
The player controls a long, thin creature, resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food, trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the edges of the playing area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer and it moves faster, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, left, or right), and the snake's body follows.
